## Our games:

### ["Reaction Time Test"](https://human-benchmark-games.vercel.app/reaction_time_test.html)

made by Vasya aka [debibl](https://github.com/debibl)

Click on the block when it turns green as fast as you can.  
You have 3 attempts, then your average reaction time and accuracy will be calculated.

### ["Visual Memory"](https://human-benchmark-games.vercel.app/visual_memory.html)

made by Klim aka [greenboxer1](https://github.com/greenboxer1)

Every level, a number of tiles will flash white. Memorize them, and pick them again after the tiles are reset.  
Levels get progressively more difficult, to challenge your skills.  
You have three lives to spare. If you miss 3 tiles on a level, you lose one life.

### ["Aim Trainer"](https://human-benchmark-games.vercel.app/aim.html)

made by Leonid aka [unh4rmed](https://github.com/unh4rmed)

Click the targets as quickly and accurately as you can.  
Once you've clicked 10 targets, your score and average time per target will be displayed.

### ["Sequence Memory"](https://human-benchmark-games.vercel.app/sequence_memory_test.html)

made by Karina aka [Memnaya](https://github.com/Memnaya)

Memorize the sequence of buttons that light up, then press them in order. Every time you finish the pattern, it gets longer.  
You have three lives to spare. If you miss 3 tiles on a level, you lose one life.  
When the game ends, you will see how many levels you have completed.
